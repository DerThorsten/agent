Agent is the configuration application of the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Agent is in a preliminary state. You can click around, and most interactions will loosely work, but the application is not production ready yet. We're experimenting with the UI, and UX until the imminent Angular 2 port.

[Give it a whirl!](http://ultimatehackingkeyboard.github.io/agent-mockup/)

## Set up instructions

```
git clone git@github.com:UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent-mockup.git
cd agent-mockup
npm install
```

In the repository you can find a `gulpfile.js` for running [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/), which speeds up the development process. You can fire it up with `gulp serve`.
